# Hasta-La-Vista
Termination analyser for logic programs with integer computations. Developed in 2002-2003 and put here for the archiving purposes only.

For more information about the ideas implemented in this tool please consult Alexander Serebrenik, Danny De Schreye: Inference of termination conditions for numerical loops in Prolog. TPLP 4(5-6): 719-751 (2004)

The tool depends on the type inference of Janssens and Bruynooghe
